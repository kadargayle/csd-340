                            <figcaption>I enjoy playing basketball at the gym whenever I get a chance. I also coach little leage basketball on my free time. 
                              Every Monday we have practice and on the weekends we have games. It's a hobby of mine that I really enjoy.

                        I have worked at Target as a merchadiser in the style department for almost 2 years now. It's been a wild journey dealing with Covid-19 and working
                        in a store that had hundreds of reports on people getting it at work. It's been one of the craziest places I've worked at since we have a lot
                        of wild customers that do a lot of outlandish things in the store.

                    <div class="hobby-content">
                       Working at the Regal movie theater coming out of high school was like a dream job at that time since I love movies. I got to see movies for free any time 
                       I wanted and got to take a plus one. It was fun eating popcorn on breaks and drinking slushies. I liked working there, but I'm glad I don't work there anymore since
                       movie theaters seem to be dying out in the near future.

                              I used to be a resident DJ at Posh NightClub in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was one of my favorite times as a DJ. I just turned 21 and I got my big break. 
                              I was a young DJ and I had created a name for myself. ALl great things must come to an end because once the pandemic came the nightclub closed.
